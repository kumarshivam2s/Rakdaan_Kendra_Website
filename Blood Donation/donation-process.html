          <p class="description1">
            The blood donation process from the time you arrive
             until the time you leave takes about an hour. The 
             donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average.
          </p>
          <h2 class="title">1. Registration</h2>
          <p class="description2">
            &bull;We’ll sign you in and go over basic eligibility.<br>
            &bull;You’ll be asked to show ID, such as your Aadhaar Card.<br>
            &bull;You’ll read some information about donating blood.<br>
            &bull;We’ll ask you for your complete address.  Your address
             needs to be complete (including House No., City, District, State, PIN Code) and Phone Number & E-mail ID.
          </p>
          <h2 class="title">2. Health History</h2>
          <p class="description3">
            &bull;You’ll answer a few questions about your health history and
             places you’ve travelled, during a private and confidential interview.<br>
             &bull;You’ll tell us about any prescription and/or over the counter
             medications that may be in your system.<br>
             &bull;We’ll check your temperature, pulse, blood pressure and 
            hemoglobin level. 
          </p>
          <h2 class="title">3. Your Donation</h2>
          <p class="description4">
            &bull; If you’re donating whole blood, we’ll cleanse an area on 
            your arm and insert a brand new sterile needle for the 
            blood draw. <b>(This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.)</b><br>
            &bull;Other types of donations, such as platelets, are made 
            using an apheresis machine which will be connected to both arms.<br>
            &bull; A whole blood donation takes about 8-10 minutes, during 
            which you’ll be seated comfortably or lying down.<br>
            &bull; When approximately a pint of whole blood has been collected,
             the donation is complete and a staff person will place a 
             bandage on your arm.<br>
             &bull;For platelets, the apheresis machine will collect a small 
            amount of blood, remove the platelets, and return the rest 
            of the blood through your other arm; this cycle will be 
            repeated several times over about 2 hours. 
          </p>
          <h2 class="title">4. Refreshment and Recovery</h2>
          <p class="description5">
            &bull;After donating blood, you’ll have a snack and something to 
            drink in the refreshment area.<br>
            &bull;You’ll leave after 10-15 minutes and continue your normal routine.<br>
            &bull;Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing you are helping
             to save lives.<br>
             &bull;Take a selfie, or simply share your good deed with friends.
             &bull; It may inspire them to become blood donors.
